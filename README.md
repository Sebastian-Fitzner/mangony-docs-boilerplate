Mangony Documentation Boilerplate
</h1>

Mangony provides a nice way to generate technical documentations. Just use the boilerplate as a starting point!

## Installation

Install `mangony-docs-boilerplate` with 

``` bash
bower install mangony-docs-boilerplate --save
```

## Usage

### layouts

This folder contains a general layout to start with your technical documentation. It is the most important portion in this repository. 

If you like to generate a documentation page, you need to reference the layout with `YFM`. 

### partials

The `partials` folder contains a snippet to generate a sitemap out of the saved collections. Therefore you need to be sure, that you have added the collections option in Mangony with `type` as one value!

### styles

There are some SCSS and CSS files. Just integrate to your project to get some nice code highlighting!
